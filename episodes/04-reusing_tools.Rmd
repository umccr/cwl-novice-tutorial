::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions

- How to find other solutions/CWL recipes for awkward problems?

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

- Know good resources for finding solutions to common problems

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Pre-written tool descriptions
When you start a CWL workflow, it is recommended to check if there is already a CWL document available for the tools you want to use.
[Bio-cwl-tools][bio-cwl-tools] is a library of CWL documents for biology/life-sciences related tools.

The CWL documents of the previous steps were already provided for you, however, you can also find them in this library.
In this episode you will use the bio-cwl-tools library to add the last step to the workflow.

## Adding new step in workflow
The last step of our workflow is counting the RNA-seq reads for which we will use the [`featureCounts`][featurecounts] tool.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge

### Find the featureCounts tool in the bio-cwl-tools library ðŸŒ¶

Find the `featureCounts` tool in the [bio-cwl-tools library][bio-cwl-tools].
Have a look at the CWL document. Which inputs does this tool need? And what are the outputs of this tool?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: solution

The `featureCounts` CWL document can be found in the [GitHub repo][featurecounts-cwl].

It has three inputs:
- annotations
  - A GTF or GFF file containing the gene annotations
- mapped_reads
  - A BAM file containing the mapped reads
- reads_are_paired
  - A boolean value. These inputs can be found on lines 6, 9, and 12.

The output of this tool is a file called `featurecounts` (line 27).

### Appending the featureCounts step to the workflow

We need a local copy of `featureCounts` in order to use it in our workflow.

We already imported this as a git submodule during setup,
so the tool should be located at `bio-cwl-tools/subread/featureCounts.cwl`.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge

### Add the featureCounts tool to the workflow ðŸŒ¶ðŸŒ¶

Please copy the `rna_seq_workflow_2.cwl` file to create `rna_seq_workflow_3.cwl`.

Add the `featureCounts` tool to the workflow as a workflow step.

**Bonus**: ðŸŒ¶ðŸŒ¶ðŸŒ¶

Similar to the `STAR` tool, this tool also needs more RAM than the default.

Update the RAM used to run the tool without editing the commandlinetool

### Hint: Feature Counts Workflow Step

Use the `run` field to add the `featureCounts` tool as a step in the workflow.

### Hint: Upgrade RAM

Use a `requirements` entry with `ResourceRequirement` to allocate a `ramMin` of 500.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: solution

### Solution: workflow_input_2.yml (Click to expand)

```yaml
`r xfun::file_string('files/rna_seq_workflow_3.cwl')`
```

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


## Running the new workflow

The workflow is complete and we only need to complete the YAML input file.

Copy the `workflow_input_2.yml` file to `workflow_input_3.yml`, and
add the last entry in the input file, which is the `fruitfly_gene_model` file.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: spoiler

### workflow_input_3.yml (Click to expand)

```yaml
`r xfun::file_string('files/workflow_input_3.yml')`
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: prereq

You have finished the workflow and the input file and now you can run the whole workflow.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

```bash
cwltool --cachedir cache rna_seq_workflow_3.cwl workflow_input_3.yml
```


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints

- [bio-cwl-tools][bio-cwl-tools] is a library of CWL documents for biology/life-sciences related tools
