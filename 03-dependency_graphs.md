## Multi-Step Workflow

In the previous episode we worked through a single step workflow, carrying out a simple RNA read
of the fruitfly genome. In this episode the workflow is extended with an equivalent reverse
RNA read and the next two steps of the RNA-sequencing analysis, trimming the reads and
aligning the trimmed reads, are added.
We will be using the [`cutadapt`](https://bio.tools/cutadapt)  and [`STAR`](https://bio.tools/star) tools for these tasks.

To make a multi-step workflow that can carry all this analysis out, we add more entries
to the `steps` field.

### Naming steps

Note that when the `quality_control` step is duplicated the two
steps are named `quality_control_forward` and `quality_control_reverse`, to distinguish
the separate forward and reverse RNA reads. Likewise, the `rna_reads_fruitfly` input becomes
`rna_reads_fruitfly_forward`, and an `rna_reads_fruitfly_reverse` input is added.

::::::::::::::::::::::

The workflow file shows the first 5 steps of the RNA-seq analysis: `quality_control_reverse`,
`quality_control_forward`, `trim_low_quality_bases`, `mapping_reads`, and `index_alignment`.

The `index_alignment` step uses the `alignment` output of the `mapping_reads` step.
You do this by referencing the output of the `mapping_reads` step in the `in` field of the `index_alignment` step.
This is similar to referencing the outputs of the different steps in the `outputs` section.

:::::::::::::::::::::::: callout

### Default values

The `mapping_reads` step needs some extra information beyond the inputs from the other steps, which
is done by providing `default` values. If you want, you can read the `bio-cwl-tools/STAR/STAR-Align.cwl`
file to see how these extra inputs are transformed into command line options to the `STAR` program.
This information is provided in the `in` field.

::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::: callout

### Specifying resources

To run the tool better, it needs more RAM than the default. So there is a `requirements` entry inside
the `mapping_reads` step definition with a `ResourceRequirement` to allocate a minimum of
5120 MiB (5 GiB) of RAM.

:::::::::::::::::::::::



The newly added `mapping_reads` step also need an input not provided by any of our other steps,
therefore an additional workflow-level input is added: a directory that contains the reference genome
necessary for the mapping.

This `ref_fruitfly_genome` is added in the `inputs` field of the workflow and in the YAML input file,
`workflow_input_2.yml`.

### Exercise: Draw the workflow

Draw the connecting arrows in the following graph of our workflow. Also, provide the outputs/inputs
of the different steps. You can use for example Paint or print out the graph.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::: solution

### Solution
 To find out how the inputs and the steps are connected to each other, you look at the `in` field
 of the different steps.

## Iterative working
Working on a workflow is often not something that happens all at once.
Sometimes you already have a shell script ready that can be converted to a CWL workflow.
Other times it is similar to this tutorial, you start with a single-step workflow and extend it to
a multi-step workflow.
This is all iterative working, a continuous work in progress.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


## Visualising a workflow

To visualise a workflow, a graph can be used. This can be done before a CWL script is written to
visualise how the different steps connect to each other. It is also possible to make a graph after
the CWL script has been written. This graph can be generated using online tools or the built-in
function in `cwltool`. When a graph is generated, it can be used to visualise the steps taken and
could make it easier to explain a workflow to other researchers.

A CWL workflow is a directed acyclic graph (DAG). This means that:

1. The workflow has a certain direction, from workflow inputs to step inputs, from step outputs to
   other step inputs, and from step outputs to workflow outputs
and
2. The workflow definition has no cycles.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::: callout

### CWL workflow as a dependency graph

By being a 'DAG', a CWL workflow is a dependency graph. Each input for a step in the workflow depends on either a
workflow-level input or the presence of a particular output from another step.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::


### From CWL script to graph

In this example the workflow is already made, so the graph can be generated using
[cwlviewer](https://view.commonwl.org/) online or using `cwltool`. First, let's have a look at
[cwlviewer](https://view.commonwl.org/). To use this tool, the workflow has to be put in a GitHub,
GitLab or Git repository. To view the graph of the workflow enter the URL and click `Parse Workflow`.

The cwlviewer displays the workflow as a graph, starting with the input. Then the different steps
are shown, each with their input(s) and output(s). The steps are linked to each other using arrows
accompanied by the input of the next step. The graph ends with the workflow outputs.

The graph of the RNA-seq workflow looks a follows:

![](fig/Ep3_graph_answer.png){alt="Ep3 graph answer" style='height: "400px"'}

It is also possible to generate the graph in the command line. `cwltool` has a function that makes a
graph. The `--print-dot` option will print a file suitable for Graphviz `dot` program. This is the
command to generate a Scalable Vector Graphic (SVG) file:

```bash
cwltool --print-dot rna_seq_workflow_2.cwl | dot -Tsvg > workflow_graph_2.svg
```

The resulting SVG file displays the same graph as the one in the cwlviewer. The SVG file can be
opened in any web browser and in [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/), for example.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: callout

Windows users can run `wslview workflow_graph_2.svg` in their terminal to view the graph in the default web browser

### Visualisation in VSCode

[__Benten__](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sbg-rabix.benten-cwl) is an extension
in Visual Studio Code (VSCode) that among other things visualises a workflow in a graph. When Benten
is installed in VSCode, the tool can be used to visualise the workflow. In the top-right corner of
the VSCode window the CWL viewer can be opened, see the screenshot below.


![](fig/VSCode_CWL_Preview_(step1).png){alt='VSCode CWL Preview step 1' style='height: "400px"'}

In VSCode/Benten the inputs are shown in green, the steps in blue and the outputs in yellow. This
graph looks a little bit different from the graph made with cwlviewer or `cwltool`.
The graph by VSCode/Benten doesn't show the output-input names between the different steps.

:::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints

- A multi-step workflow has multiple entries under the `steps` section
- Workflow development can be an iterative process
- A CWL workflow can be represented as a dependency graph, either to explain your workflow or as a planning tool
