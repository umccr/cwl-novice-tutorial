## Linux Setup

<br>

### Install VSCode

Download and install [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

<br>

### VSCode extensions


**Install Benten VSCode Extension**

[Open Benten in the marketplace][benten_vs_code_marketplace] and click the `Install` button.

If you are given the option to enable the extension on 'WSL: Ubuntu' please do so.


**Install Redhat Yaml VSCode Extension**

[Open RedHad Yaml in the marketplace][redhat_yaml_vs_code_marketplace] and click the `Install` button.

If you are given the option to enable the extension on 'WSL: Ubuntu' please do so.


#### Attribute CWL files to the yaml file type

Add the following chunk to the VSCode [user settings json][user_settings_json] to attribute CWL to the YAML file type.

```json
{
    "files.associations": {
        "*.cwl": "yaml"
    }
}
```

<br>

### Install Docker

[Click here to follow the instructions for installing docker on linux][docker_server_install]

<br>

:::::::: callout

## Extra action if you install Docker using Snap
[Snap](https://snapcraft.io/) is an app management system for linux - which is popular on
Ubuntu and other systems. Docker is available via Snap - if you have installed it using
this service you will need to take the following steps, to ensure docker will work properly.

```bash
mkdir ~/tmp
export TMPDIR=~/tmp
```

Each time you open a new terminal you will have to enter the `export TMPDIR=~/tmp` command,
or you can add it to your `~/.profile` or `~/.bashrc` file.

::::::::::::::

#### Enable docker usage as a non-root user

Follow the instructions in the Docker documentation to [enable docker usage as a non-root user][enable_user_docker_usage]

You will need to logout for this to take effect.


### Install cwltool

First we will make a Python virtual environment by running the following commands in the terminal.

```bash
python3 -m venv env       # Create a virtual environment named 'env' in the current directory
source env/bin/activate   # Activate the 'env' environment
```

You will know that this worked as the terminal prompt will now have `(env)` at the beginning.

:::::::::::: callout

### Reactivating the python virtual environment

Every time you launch VS Code or launch a new terminal, you must run `source env/bin/activate`
to re-enable access to this Python Virtual Environment.

::::::::::::::

Next, install cwltool by running the following in the terminal:

```bash
pip install cwltool
```

Later we will make visualisations of our workflows.
To support that we need to install `graphviz`.

##### Install graphviz

Here is the command for Debian-based Linux systems to install `graphviz` and other helpful programs:

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y graphviz wget git nodejs
```

For other Linux systems, check [the graphviz download page][graphviz_download_page]
