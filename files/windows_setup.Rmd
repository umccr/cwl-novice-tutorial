## Windows Setup

### WSL2 Installation

::::::::::::::::::prereq

Ensure you're running Windows 10 or higher

To check your Windows version and build number, press the Windows logo key + <kbd>R</kbd>, type `winver`, select OK.
You can update to the latest Windows version by selecting "Start" > "Settings" > "Windows Update" > "Check for updates".

It is also expected you download the 'terminal' app from the Microsoft store:

::::::::::::::::::

Follow the [wsl installation instructions][wsl_installation_instructions].

You may also wish to go through [Getting started with WSL2][getting_started_with_wsl2].

::::::::::::::: callout

For this tutorial, we expect you use the Ubuntu distribution.

::::::::::::::::

### Confirm WSL2 is installed

Open PowerShell as Administrator and type in the following

```
wsl --list
```

You should see your linux distribution you have installed in the previous step.

### Installing apt tools

For this tutorial, we will require a few linux tools to be installed.

Open up the 'terminal' app and select a new tab of the Ubuntu version you have just installed

```bash
sudo apt-get update -y -q && \
sudo apt-get install -y -q \
  python3-venv \
  wget \
  graphviz \
  nodejs \
  wslu
```

### Install Docker Desktop

Install Docker Desktop by following the instructions on the [Docker Desktop Installation Page][windows_docker_desktop_installation_page]

* Accept the terms and conditions, if prompted
* Wait for Docker Desktop to finish starting
* Skip the tutorial, if prompted


#### Ensure Docker Desktop is Using the WSL2 Backend

* From the top menu choose "Settings" > "General"

* Make sure 'Use the WSL 2 based engine' is selected


### VSCode Installation

Download and install [VSCode][vs_code]


#### Install VSCode Extensions



**Install the WSL Integration extension**

[Open WSL2 Extension in the marketplace][remote_wsl_vs_code_marketplace]

You should now see 'WSL Targets' under the 'Remote Explorer' tab on the left hand side of the screen.

Right-click Ubuntu to set it as the default distribution



**Install Benten VSCode Extension**

[Open Benten in the marketplace][benten_vs_code_marketplace] and click the `Install` button.

If you are given the option to enable the extension on 'WSL: Ubuntu' please do so.



**Install Redhat Yaml VSCode Extension**

[Open RedHad Yaml in the marketplace][redhat_yaml_vs_code_marketplace] and click the `Install` button.

If you are given the option to enable the extension on 'WSL: Ubuntu' please do so.



#### Attribute CWL files to the yaml file type

Add the following chunk to the VSCode [user settings json][user_settings_json] to attribute CWL to the YAML file type.

```json
{
    "files.associations": {
        "*.cwl": "yaml"
    }
}
```


### Install cwltool (latest)

First we will make a Python virtual environment by running the following commands in the terminal.

```bash
python3 -m venv env       # Create a virtual environment named 'env' in the current directory
source env/bin/activate   # Activate the 'env' environment
```

You will know that this worked as the terminal prompt will now have `(env)` at the beginning.


### Reactivating the python virtual environment

Every time you launch VS Code or launch a new terminal, you must run `source env/bin/activate`
to re-enable access to this Python Virtual Environment.

Next, install cwltool by running the following in the terminal:

```bash
pip install cwltool
```
